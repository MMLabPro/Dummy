He will receive six million euros per season from the \"Vecchia Signora.\"\r\nOne of the players for whom there have been the most offers in recent transfer windows is Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. The European giants have shown an interest in the Serbian midfielder who is currently playing for Lazio.\r\nHe was most wanted by Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Arsenal, among others. According to \"La Gazzetta dello Sport,\" the 27-year-old midfielder has almost agreed to accept an offer from Juventus, who need to add big-name signings to rebuild a competitive squad. However, everything seems to indicate that his future will continue in Italy's Serie A.\r\nTo appreciate his talent, the Turin city club is willing to pay him six million euros per season. The player might want to acknowledge these circumstances.\r\nIt is certain that the Italians are in the lead to sign the Serbian, but it remains to be seen whether Juve will make a bid for him during the winter transfer window or wait until mid-2023 to secure his arrival at a price that is more reasonable."
